      "question": "Background",
      "answer": "Shortly after the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, the islamic regime imposed a mandatory hijab on women. Since then, many forms of law enforncement have been implemented to force women to wear hijab, the most recent one being the morality police which has been active since 2005. Mahsa Amini was a young girl from Saqqez, Iran who wanted to spend a few days in Tehran with her Family. While she was in Tehran, she was arrested by the morality police and after a few hours she was taken to the hospital due to severe traumatic brain injury. After two days in coma, she died at age 22. Mahsa's death resulted in large-scale protests across Iran, demanding justice for her, and fighting for women's basic human rights and freedom. The government of Iran is attempting to suppress the protests, shooting protesters, deploying tear gas and water cannons, and blocking access to the internet. So far, many people have been murdered, beaten, and have gotten arrested."
